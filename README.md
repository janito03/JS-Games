# JS little games

1. Guess The Number - In the Guess the Number game, the computer randomly selects a number within a set range, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the game gives feedback — such as “too high” or “too low” — until the correct number is found.
   
2. Pig Game - The Pig Game is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. A player can roll as many times as they want during their turn, but if they roll a 1, they lose all points from that turn and pass the die to the other player.
